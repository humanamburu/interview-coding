# interview-coding

This section includes two parts which are implementing coding task and adding test cases for the solution. During the coding session, we are asking you to implement a function that generates a stats object for the movies array in the format.

```
    getMoviesStatsByGenre(movies, 1972);
```

```
const movies = [
    {
        title: "The Shawshank Redemption",
        year: 1994,
        director: "Frank Darabont",
        duration: "2h 22min",
        genre: ["Crime", "Drama"],
        rate: 9.3,
    },
    {
        title: "The Godfather",
        year: 1972,
        director: "Francis Ford Coppola",
        duration: "2h 55min",
        genre: ["Comedy"],
        rate: 9.2,
    }
]
```
